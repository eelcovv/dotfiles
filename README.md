# dotfiles

My personal Linux dotfiles, symlinked to my home directory with [GNU Stow](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/stow/).

Please refer to each subdirectory for instructions.

> I switched to using Nix as my package manager and [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) as the program to manage my HOME directory, so I no longer maintain this repository. I now keep the configuration for all of all my programs in this other repository: [nix-config](https://github.com/jackdbd/nix-config).
