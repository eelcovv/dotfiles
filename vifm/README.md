# vifm

Configuration for the Vifm file manager.

To create the symlinks in the home directory, run the following command from **this** directory:

```sh
stow . --target ~
```

In order to display icons in vifm you need to install a font patched using [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

The code that loads the icons in my `.vifmrc` is taken from [here](https://github.com/yanzhang0219/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/vifm).
